# texbook-mfbook-bugs
This repo records the bugs I found in Donald Knuth's *Computers & Typesetting* volumes, especially *The TeXbook* and *The METAFONTbook*.
[Here is a list of the bugs.](https://github.com/dine2014/texbook-mfbook-bugs/blob/master/bugs.md)

Knuth fixed most of them in the 2021 tuneup. In this repo you can also find my reward check.
